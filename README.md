# protegon
2D game engine made without the use of any external libraries other than SDL2 for drawing pixels to a screen.

The engine code is located in the ```Engine/engine/``` folder

The folder called ```Bayes``` contains a Hopper simulation built with the engine.

The folder called ```Game``` contains a test game application built with the engine.

Both of these will later be moved outside of this GitHub repository.
